*maximizing the GUI and then changing tabs makes is turn into the default size
*Switching quickly from one tab to the other makes it reload it all again (should be saved on cache or just hidden behind one another so the webpage doesn't need to reload).
*switching quickly ends up in the GUI losing connection to local host
*Before any filter is applied it should list all bots
*Add some kind of animation to indicate the bot is being downloaded
*Pressing More Info on a bot doesn't show anything
*Some kind of way to show which tab are we on currently, and to be able to indicate these are tabs would be appreciated (some visuals like chrome tabs have)
