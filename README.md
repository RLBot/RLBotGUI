# Rocket League Story Mode

This project used RLBot and RLBotGui to provide a Story Mode for
Rocket League. The story UI runs in your browser and it can
start games to continue with the story.

Here are some images from the UI.


Works on Windows and Linux

## Status

The current Story Mode is fully functioning. Your saves are persisted,
you can recruit players, you can purchase upgrades on your way
to taking over more cities.

Here are things that can use additional work/feedback:

### Features to add

    - Adding support for "bot personas". Currently bots are just added
      with their bot names and using their default appearance. If a bot is
      used in different cities, they look the same. We should instead have 
      different "persona" in each city with different names and different looks.
    - Recruited teammate customization: Players should be able to customize
      their teammates' looks.
    - Should other types of challenges be added? Other types of stats to track?

### Bot recommendations

The current selection of bots was chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Recommendation
on bots that fit specific challenges would be great. Additionally, ideas
for challenges that use particular skills of bots would be valuable too.

### UI Improvements

    - Adding more animation and sound when a user succeeds might be good
    - The CSS and HTML layout is pretty ad-hoc right now. Cleaning that up
    would be good.
