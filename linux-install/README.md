# RLBotGUI via LISS
This stands for the Rocket League Bot Graphical User Interface via the Linux Installation Shell Script.

## First-time installation with LISS

1. Download `RLBotGUI.sh` (Or save [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RLBot/RLBotGUI/master/linux-install/RLBotGUI.sh))
2. `chmod +x path/to/RLBotGUI.sh`
3. `path/to/RLBotGUI` (`./RLBotGUI` if it's in the current folder)
4. You will be asked to provide your sudo password. The RLBotGUI requires sudo in order to run:

   - `sudo apt install software-properties-common` (If needed)
   - `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` (If needed; this is the Linux Python archive - https://github.com/deadsnakes)
   - `sudo apt update`
   - `sudo apt install build-essential python3.7-dev python3.7-venv python3-distutils` (If needed)

   We won't do anything else with the sudo permission you give us, and is only required for installation.

5. Once LISS does its thing, the RLBotGUI will open! You can now take `RLBotGUI.sh` and put it wherever in your system you want. The RLBotGUI has been installed, and you won't need to do it again. (Unless something breaks, then you will have to re-download this script.)

## Opening RLBotGUI after installation

1. Where ever you've put `RLBotGUI.sh`, run it using `path/to/RLBotGUI.sh`
3. LISS will now update all dependencies, if you have internet access. (`pip`, `setuptools`, `wheel`, `eel`, `rlbot_gui` and `rlbot`)
4. RLBotGUI will then launch in Chrome, or your defaut system browser if Chrome isn't installed.
