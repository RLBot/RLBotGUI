    # Update the config file to point to the renamed files, and show the correct bot name.

    # This is not an ideal way of modifying the config file, because:
    # - It uses our custom ConfigObject class, which is limited / buggy, and we should be moving away from it
    # - The ConfigObject class is not capable of 'round-tripping', i.e. if you parse a config file and then
    #   write it again, the comment lines will not be preserved.
    # - It can still write comments, but only if they have a 'description' that has been added programmatically
    #   (see base_create_agent_configurations).
    #
    # One route is to add 'description' items for all the stuff we care about, including the stuff here
    # https://github.com/RLBot/RLBotPythonExample/blob/master/python_example/python_example.cfg#L11-L27
    # so that the resulting file is sortof the same (might have slightly different formatting). That's annoying
    # and hard to maintain though, and again we'd be investing more in this custom config class that I would
    # prefer to get rid of.
    #
    # Alternatives:
    #
    # Use the configobj library https://configobj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configobj.html
    # - I tried this in https://github.com/IamEld3st/RLBotGUI/commit/a30308940dd5a0e4a45db6ccc088e6e75a9f69f0
    #   which worked well for me, but people reported issues during installation. If we can get the installation
    #   ironed out, it will be a nice solution for modifying cfg files in general.
    #
    # Do a simple find-and-replace in the file
    # - Very crude, but it can be reliable if we use specific commit hashes like I did in
    #   https://github.com/IamEld3st/RLBotGUI/commit/a30308940dd5a0e4a45db6ccc088e6e75a9f69f0
    # - It would get us up and running with the new features until we can figure out a proper config modification
    #   solution.
